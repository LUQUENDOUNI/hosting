                    The history of the trick dates back to the 19th century in Argentina and Uruguay. It is considered a Creole card game, born in the slums of Buenos Aires and Montevideo during the time of Spanish colonization and the great European immigration to the region.
                     <br>
                     The term "trick" comes from the Spanish "truc", which means "deceit" or "trick". From its inception, the game was noted for being a popular form of entertainment for the working class and common people.
                     Over time, the trick became an important symbol of Argentine and Uruguayan culture, present at family gatherings, social events, and friendly competitions. Its popularity has transcended the borders of both countries, becoming known in other Latin American nations due to migration and cultural exchange.

                <p class="pag2__sectionB__p">
                    According to the 15th century playing cards discovered in the Topkapi Palace, the Spanish deck comes from the Ottoman deck: four suits, three figures, ten numbers. <br>
                     On its journey into the hands of the Spanish people, its iconography was adapted to the customs of Western Europe. Thus, the "polo cue" became "rough", figures such as the jack (representation of the page, that young hidalgo at the service of the nobleman) appeared, and the sword left its curved cutlass shape in favor of a straight one. <br>
                     Everything seems to indicate that the trick, in the same way, has an Arab origin. <br>
                     The etymology comes from the word "truk" or "truch", and designates all the tricks necessary for your game. A legend encrypts the origin of its rules in a small robbery. Determined to play war, some Moorish children took their elders' deck of cards and removed kings, knights and jacks to cut them out and use them as walking figures. The ace of coins was encrypted as a symbol and the ace of cups was the prize. <br>
                     Annoyed at the impossibility of playing a briscola game, the elders took that decimated deck and developed the first rules of truk.
                    
                     Known as “joc de truc” in Valencia, the game traveled to South America with the waves of migrants. Thus, in the same way that it is played in the Balearic Islands or Cuenca, it spread to grocery stores and colonial settlements in Argentina, Uruguay, southern Chile and the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul. In Murcia, for example, it has its own values and is known as “truque”. And also in Galicia, where, it is suspected, he disembarked with those returning migrants. <br>
